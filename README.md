# Cuda Accelerated Vector kNN

kNN implementation supports only 64-bit binary vectors but can be extended to support any vector type. Such an extension would not require any alteration to the existing radix select implementation. 

## VectorDB

VectorDB is...

## How it works

We used binary vectors so that...

Radix sort is a method of sorting...

Radix select is a variation that...

Our implementation of radix selection is...

Our implementation of kNN...
