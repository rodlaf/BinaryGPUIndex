# GPU Accelerated Vector Database

A Proof-of-Concept vector database that supports insertion and K Nearest Neighbors search. The only supported vector is a 64-bit binary vector for simplicity of implementation and usage of space.

While this implementation can only support 64-bit binary vector, it can be extended to support any vector type, including vectors of non-binary elements such as floating point values. Such an extension would not require any alteration to the existing radix select implementation, only to the computation of distances.

In addition to supporting only 64-bit binary vectors, the only vector key, or ID, is a 16-byte UUID. Again, this was chosen for simplicity and speed of implementation. Support for arbitrarily-sized string as vector keys can be implemented easily.

## Dependencies

- Cuda 12.0
- Crow 1.0
